# hello-world
Getting started on github and definitely need to learn some things first!

My name is Delainey, and I'm trying to learn different programming languages for a career change.  I'm currently working in python and have learned some HTML and CSS.

I have a cat names Tommy and he is amazing.  Maybe will make a program that only projects Tommy pics of the day who knows.
